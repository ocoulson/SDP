1) Write Instruction classes for :
    a) addInstruction - Done
    b) subInstruction - Done
    c) mulInstruction - Done
    d) divInstruction - Done
    e) outInstruction - Done
    f) bnzInstruction - Done

2) Update pattern matching statement in Translator to account for other types of instructions. - Done

3) Replace pattern matching statement with a reflection mechanism - Done

4) Check the recursive problem - related to the bnz instruction - check if there are more instructions, possibly
involves adding extra code at the end of the instruction classes.
